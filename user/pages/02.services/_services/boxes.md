D**evelopmental Edit:** When you have taken your piece as far as you can on your own, it is time for a developmental edit. This edit will help you refine your writing by working on story structure, pacing, character development, voice, clarity, and plot. It looks at the big picture as well as writing technique. This results in a 5-8 page letter itemizing improvements to your manuscript as well as comprehensive in-line edits that point to problems within the manuscript and helps improve your writing at a sentence level.

**Cost:** $0.02-$0.03 a word. Prices vary based on the length and complexity of the work.

M**anuscript Assessment:** If you are on a tight budget or are looking for a developmental editor’s eye without the in-line edits, then you want a manuscript assessment. The editor will read your manuscript and send back an in-depth critique discussing big-picture edits. This can be for completed or unfinished works depending on what stage you want the editor to review it. This results in a 5-8 page letter but no in-line edits. 

**Cost:** $0.005 a word, $350 minimum.

P**artial Developmental Edit and Assessment Package:** Can’t decide between a full developmental edit and an assessment? This package gives you the best of both worlds. You get an in-depth critique on the full manuscript as well as in-line edits for part of the manuscript. This package allows you to tackle the larger issues while getting in-line edits that you can then apply to the rest of the manuscript. It is up to you how much of your manuscript has in-line edits, but we recommend the first 50 pages.

**Cost:** $0.005 a word for the full manuscript plus $0.015 a word for the in-line edits (calculated based on the number of words receiving in-line edits). This complicated math results in a flat rate.

S**econd-Read Review:** After you have already had a developmental edit, an assessment, or you’ve been coached by us, you can have us read the piece again and review your changes. After you have made substantial edits it can be hard to tell if the edits were an improvement, if you need to go even further, or if they didn’t work at all. This results in 1-2 page critique of your edited manuscript.

Cost: $0.003 a word, $175 minimum.
