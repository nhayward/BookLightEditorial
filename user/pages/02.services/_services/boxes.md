D**evelopmental Editing:** This is for authors who have a completed manuscript. The editor looks through the manuscript to help with pace, characters, plot issues, structure, and voice. It takes a close look at each individual sentence. The editor looks at each sentence and the story as a whole to help with clarity and structure. This results in a report full of feedback and a manuscript returned with in-line edits, comments, and possible changes marked throughout.

W**riting Coaching:** This is for authors that have a solid idea of what they want their book to be, but haven't written it yet. The editor encourages your writing and gives you advice as you write. They also shape the story arc, help you to organize your thoughts, clarify for the reader, and focus your story. In order to provide focused and equal time to all of the editor's monthly clients, they will set aside specific days to focus on your project and respond to your questions. Writing coaching includes two phone calls a month, detailed emailing once a week, and editing pages as you go. The first month includes outline writing and editing of the first twenty pages; every additional month includes fifty pages of editing.

M**anuscript Assessment:** This is for authors on a tighter budget. You want an editor's eye but you can't afford a full developmental edit. The editor will read your manuscript and send back an overview discussing major changes and suggestions. This can be for completed or unfinished works depending on what stage you want the editor to review it. There will be no in-line edits.

E**-book Quality Assurance:** This takes a look at the complete or published e-book and reads through the entire book looking for layout errors or other errors introduced while converting a manuscript into an e-book.
