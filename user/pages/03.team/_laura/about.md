#### Laura Dennison

_**Senior Copyeditor**_

Laura is an editor and fellow writer from New Hampshire. She has been editing professionally for two years and offers services to authors who feel their manuscript could benefit from one final pair of eyes before it is sent out—whether to an agent or for indie publication.

Laura received her degree in English from the University of New Hampshire and with a focus on editing and copyediting through the school’s English Journalism program. In addition, she received her Masters of Fine Arts in Creative Nonfiction from Southern New Hampshire University. She has written a YA memoir and attended many writing residencies.

As both a writer and an editor, Laura is able to accurately edit for clarity and consistency while preserving the nuances of your style and voice. She understands the importance of producing a polished final project that you can be just as sure of as you are proud of.

If she’s not editing or writing, you can probably find her at home, watching documentaries on Netflix or dancing around her bedroom singing along to Sia (probably very loudly and off-key).

##### Specialties:

Young adult, new adult, and middle grade fiction. She specializes in nonfiction essay collections, memoir, and coming-of-age novels (especially ones that tackle heavy topics). She does not read horror, but will read any other genres not listed on the basis of quality.
