><span class="first-character">I</span>'ve been lucky to work with several editors who've improved my books and made me a better writer. I appreciate Carly's style. The feedback is concise and easy to understand. Her willingness to discuss not just this first book but where I'm going in the series is a great help, the kind of support I need as I try something new.

><span class="first-character">I</span> met Carly the same day I saw Mad Max Fury Road, so she'll forever be linked in my mind to Furiosa--someone you absolutely want on your side! With Carly's guidance, I turned my pretty okay novel into something so much more, something alive. I always felt she loved my characters as much as I did--she simply got what I was trying to do, and helped me do it. I have no doubt that my book (and hopefully many to come) are vastly improved by her involvement.

><span class="first-character">C</span>arly has given me outstanding feedback on my manuscript and I am extremely happy I found her. What I have loved about her critique is that she provides very concrete and easy to understand advice. She identified specific issues with my manuscript and then gave me ideas about how to fix them. Another thing I appreciate is that she gave me rationale for why certain things weren't working. Once I heard that the intro to my Romance was reading like a YA, I was all in.

>In addition to the full manuscript, Carly has helped with my novel synopsis and she has reread revised sections of the manuscript. Each time, she has given me greater insight into what I've put on the page, and she has helped me understand how readers, agents and publishers will see it. All the while, she has been very encouraging and excited about my work. I couldn't hope for a better editor.

><span class="first-character">I</span> worked with Carly as part of the Pitch to Publication contest and I am so grateful to have had the opportunity. She donated her time to edit my manuscript and helped hammer out the kinks and added a nice polish to the prose. She is a razor sharp editor and working together is a real partnership where you focus on the essentials: story, style, and character. She motivates you to elevate the material, trim the fat, and kill your darlings. Over the course of multiple drafts with Carly, my work improved immensely due to her feedback and suggestions. She'll even help craft a query letter that catches an agent's attention. I highly recommend working with this supportive and generous individual.

><span class="first-character">C</span>arly has completed two developmental edits for me within the past two years on two separate manuscripts. Both times I was impressed with not only the turn-around time, but how thorough her feedback was. She helped me see my projects from a reader's perspective but also offered advice on the marketability of it. Her enthusiasm for my work was met with a perfect balance of constructive criticism. While I had no doubt she's in my corner, she also wasn't afraid to challenge. Because of this, I'm able to put out the best work possible. Always a professional, she's also someone I can't wait to share a cuppa with someday.

><span class="first-character">W</span>hen I hired Carly to provide a developmental edit for my story, I had a gut instinct that she would be the right person for the job. I'm oozing with excitement over the changes in my book. I loved my story before but now I'm in love with it. Carly's feedback is worth every penny. She thoughtfully committed to my characters and their struggles, highlighting the key issues that were keeping my writing from reaching its full potential. She challenged me to take on some dramatic changes and I can't thank her enough for the outcome. If you want to take your book to the next level, Carly is the editor for you. It also helps that she's a joy to work with.

><span class="first-character">I</span> had the pleasure to work with Carly during the first Pitch to Publication event. We had a relatively short time to implement her suggestions due to contest constraints, but the critique she gave me was clear and concise. Her encouragement and expertise in the genre was invaluable for story crafting. Carly's suggestions for character development were spot-on and helped me make my MC so much more relatable. I recommend her as a valuable development resource!

She helped me make my story the best it could be and I'd recommend her to anyone looking to take their manuscript to the next level. Thanks Carly!

><span class="first-character">I</span>n Carlyâ€™s developmental editing of my novel, she dealt with issues, both large and small. Chronology, plot consistency, character motivation, authentic dialogue, point of view, word choices, etc. I appreciated the exhaustive detail and acuteness of her perceptions, but even more than that, I especially valued her understanding of my intent and my overall vision. She kept true to my vision for the novel and helped greatly in turning that vision into a reality.
